# Reverse-Engineering-Challenges
A repository where I'll be posting solutions (but not exclusively) to reverse engineering challenges, such as crackmes, keygenmes, etc.

In the future I intend to post solutions to wargames, CTF's and even a few malwares I've already analysed in the past. If you see this repo and don't find a solution to a challenge you are stuck on, you can contact me so we can think about it together. I love talking about these things. I'm not an expert, just a student trying to improve. :)

This repository is made for people that are trying to verse themselves in information security, like myself. I'll document my learning process here. This also helps me since I'm terrible at writing documents.

### Other subjects:
* #### Linux Kernel Development
 _On this repository I'll document my journey on learning Linux Kernel Programming, and eventually I hope I'll be able to reproduce a PoC for known and already    patched vulnerabilites:_ https://github.com/lfontesm/linux-kernel-development
