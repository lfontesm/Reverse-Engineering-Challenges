# Reverse-Engineering-Challenges
A repository where I'll be posting solutions (but not exclusively) to reverse engineering challenges, such as crackmes, keygenmes, etc.

In the future I intend to post solutions to wargames, CTF's and even a few malwares I've already analysed in the past. If you see this repo and don't find a solution to a challenge you are stuck on, you can contact me so we can think about it together. I love talking about these things. I'm not an expert, just a student trying to improve. :)
